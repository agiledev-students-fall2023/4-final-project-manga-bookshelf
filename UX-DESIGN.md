## App Map

1. There are four unique design templates: Home, Your Profile, Other User Profiles, and Manga Info.

2. The Home is what users will see first when they enter the app. 

3. From the Home, you can view your list directy with the click of a button or use the search bar to find other users to follow or information for various manga titles to track, hence the direct child relationship of the templates. 

4. The number of manga titles is unbounded since there are always new titles coming out, hence the stack in the diagram. This also applies to other user profiles as new users keep creating accounts.
