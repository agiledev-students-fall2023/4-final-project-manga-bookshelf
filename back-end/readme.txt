The back-end of your project will live in this directory.

You will most likely initiate the back-end Node.js/Express.js server by running the "npm init" command from within this directory.

Normally I would use MVC architecutrte but I want to try to structure the folder this way

Basically, separate not by MVC but by each item that we are creating in the MVC folders 

so one folder to handle auth 

one folder to handle retrieving all the manga data

maybe one folder for forum 

etc 

import the helper function to use the jikan api 

alright thsi is hard than i thought cjs is disgusting 

just write all the routes in app.mjs for now
