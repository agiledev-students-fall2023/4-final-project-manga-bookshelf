## Project Description
The manga bookshelf project is an application to track readers' manga and share what they've read or are reading with other users on the platform through their profile pages after logging in. The vision for the future revolves around features like:
- user logins and profiles with their lists displayed
- four lists for users: Favorites, Reading, Want to Read, Finished
- trending manga on the home page
- following other users to see their lists
- search for manga and other user profiles
