The only things omitted are the background of the author's crime, trial, sentancing and release but an interview with the author and a commentary by the anime critic Tomohide Kure (who was involved in Hanawa's defence) are included to shed some light on these aspects.","imageRemotePath":"http:\/\/cdn.animenewsnetwork.com\/thumbnails\/fit200x200\/encyc\/A4819-4.jpg","genres":["psychological","slice of life"],"alternativeTitles":["Dans la prison","En la Prisión","Keimusho no Naka","刑務所の中"],"staff":[{"person":"Kazuichi Hanawa","task":"Story & Art"}]},{"title":"Tanabata no Kuni","id":10918,"imageRemotePath":"http:\/\/cdn.animenewsnetwork.com\/thumbnails\/fit200x200\/encyc\/A10918-4.jpg","genres":[],"alternativeTitles":["七夕の国","七夕之國"],"staff":[{"person":"Hitoshi Iwaaki","task":"Story & Art"}]},{"title":"Alice Love Fables: Toy Box","bayesianAverage":6.49325,"id":15611,"genres":["fantasy","romance"],"alternativeTitles":["Renai Otogibanashi: Toy Box","恋愛おとぎ話 ～Toy Box～","戀愛童話 ～Toy Box～"],"staff":[{"person":"Mamenosuke Fujimaru","task":"Story & Art"}]},{"title":"Regatta","id":10571,"imageRemotePath":"http:\/\/cdn.animenewsnetwork.com\/thumbnails\/fit200x200\/encyc\/A10571-11.jpg","genres":[],"alternativeTitles":["レガッタ 君といた永遠","新三人時代"],"staff":[{"person":"Hidenori Hara","task":"Story & Art"}]},{"title":"Meteor Strike","bayesianAverage":6.68506,"id":8136,"plotSummary":"Shinya, a weak yet noble middle-school boy, is one day struck by a meteor.
