## My Profile Wireframe 

1. Edit profile button will allow the user to edit their profile, including their profile picture, name, and bio. 

2. Users will be able to add their favorite manga to the favorite section by clicking on the yellow star. In addition, there will be a feature where the users can add and remove the manga that they are currently reading, wanting to read, or finished reading. 

3. By clicking on the follower and the following button, the users can see the profiles that they are following as well as their current followers, similar how instagram implements these features.
