# Manga Bookshelf Annotations

## Home Page
1. Users will be able to scroll horizontally to view all the trending, recently updated, and "My List" manga.

2. Under each manga, the name of the manga will be displayed. In the top right corner of each manga, there is a star button for users to add that manga to their favorite list.

3. Every time a user clicks the Logo, it will bring them back to the home page.

4. There is also a search button in the header for users to search for manga, and the top-right hamburger menu is for users to visit their profile page.


## My Profile Wireframe 

1. Edit profile button will allow the user to edit their profile, including their profile picture, name, and bio. 

2. Users will be able to add their favorite manga to the favorite section by clicking on the yellow star. In addition, there will be a feature where the users can add and remove the manga that they are currently reading, wanting to read, or finished reading. 

3. By clicking on the follower and the following button, the users can see the profiles that they are following as well as their current followers, similar how instagram implements these features.
